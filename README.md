Hi, I'm Simon. I live in Washington DC, and I'm a long time OCaml programmer, also interested in Odin and Rust. Besides automatic theorem proving, my academic specialty up to my PhD, postdoc, and industry job at https://imandra.ai, I've also worked on observability/tracing, HTTP server implementations, distributed systems, RPC systems, and type checkers.
