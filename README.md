Hi, I'm Simon. I live in Washington DC, and I'm a long time OCaml programmer, also interested in Odin and Rust. Besides automatic theorem proving, my academic specialty up to my PhD, postdoc, and industry job at https://imandra.ai, I've also worked on observability/tracing, HTTP server implementations, distributed systems, RPC systems, and type checkers. I have been contributing open source libraries to the OCaml ecosystem since 2012. I enjoy strongly, statically typed programming languages; binary serialization formats[^1]; well designed network protocols; content-addressing[^2]; RFCs. I've been using git daily since 2010; archlinux since 2012; and (n)vim since 2008. My beard is literally greying üßôüèª.

[^2]: not blockchain though, I'm not into rugpulls.
